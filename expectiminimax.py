def minimax(problem, prune=False):
    '''Takes a 2-player game and uses minimax search to calculate and return a strategy for the game. The strategy is a dictionary that maps states to pairs. The first element is an optimal action in that state. The second element of the pair is the minimax score of the state. If the prune parameter is True, the algorithm uses alpha-beta pruning. In that case, pruned states do not appear in the strategy. After this function executes, the state of problem should be the same as when it was passed in.'''
