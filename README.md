# gobblet-solver
Monte Carlo Tree Search on Gobblet, a Tic-Tac-Toe like game with a large branching factor and complex game space. 


This project was built by Julianne Lin, Nandeeka Nayak, and Iris Zhou, as the final project for CSCI151 (Artificial Intelligence) at Harvey Mudd College. The game code was modified from Prof. Erin Talvitie's Tic-Tac-Toe code, and the MCTS code is based on [Analytics Vidhya's](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/01/monte-carlo-tree-search-introduction-algorithm-deepmind-alphago/) article on the technique.
